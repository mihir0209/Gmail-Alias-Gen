- **Organize Like a Pro:** Paste your aliases into Google Keep, Todoist, or any checklist app. Each alias becomes a tickable item. Stay organized, stay ahead!
- **Alias Intelligence:** Add website names or notes next to each alias in your checklist so you always know where you used them.
- **Spam Buster:** If an alias gets spammed, you‚Äôll know exactly who sold you out. Block or filter that alias in Gmail with a click.
- **One-Click Unsubscribe:** Set up Gmail filters to auto-archive, label, or delete emails sent to a specific alias.
- **Password Simplicity:** Use the same password for all aliases (or not-your call). Pair with a password manager for true mastery.
